Simple Calculator App made with React Js

ðŸ¦´COMPONENTSðŸ¦´
This Calculator is made up of only one Component, which is the Calculator component.

ðŸ¦´FUNCTIONALITYðŸ¦´
This Calculator allows basic calculations of addition, subtraction, Multiplication and Division. I made this possible using eval but to keep out the vulnerability presented to us by the eval function, so the only logic that can be evaluated is strictly a mathematical logic.

Lol, My emphasis on this calculator is the design, I was glad I implemented neumorphism without stress.
